# Simple trained model to detect if a person is sleeping (lying) on their back

Code mostly used the Hopenet implementation from the paper:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.00925.pdf

Hopenet implementation taken from:
https://github.com/natanielruiz/deep-head-pose

as well as pytorch pre-trained model (on resnet50)
